- a new "onClear" event is now available; a function attached to this event will be executed when a date is cleared; thanks to **Alan** for suggesting;
- added a new configuration option: "zero_pad"; setting it to FALSE will prevent the script from prefixing day numbers < 10 with zeroes (so, it will be "1" instead of "01"); thanks to **Nicky** for suggesting;
- added 2 new configuration options: "days_abbr" and "months_abbrs" for specifying custom abbreviations for days and month names (useful for languages where the abbreviation is not as simple as the first 2 or 3 letters); thanks to **RATI**!;
- the functions attached to the onSelect and onChange events will now receive an extra argument being a reference to the element the date picker is attached to, as a jQuery object;

## version 1.5 (September 30, 2012)

- a new "onChange" event is now triggered whenever the user changes the view (days/months/years), as well as when the user navigates by clicking on the "next"/"previous" icons in any of the views; the callback function called by this event takes two arguments - the view (days/months/years) and the "active" elements (not disabled) in that view, as jQuery elements allowing for easy customization and interaction with particular cells in the date picker's view; read more about this in the [configuration](http://stefangabos.ro/jquery/zebra-datepicker/#configuration) section; thanks to **Russell** for suggesting;
- fixed two bugs introduced in the previous version that made the icon to be incorrectly positioned in Internet Explorer 6, 7 & 8 and also made the library trigger a warning message in these browsers;
- fixed a bug where setting the "disabled_dates" attribute to something else other than an array, would trigger an error in Internet Explorer 6 & 7; thanks to **myapi**

## version 1.4.2 (September 22, 2012)

- fixed a bug where the icon would not be placed correctly if the element the plugin is attached to had margins;
- fixed some small bugs in the CSS and in the JavaScript code;
- calling the "update" method will now also recalculate the parent element's position and place the icon accordingly; use it when you show/hide/reposition the parent element or you alter the parent element's dimensions;

## version 1.4.1 (July 29, 2012)

- fixed a bug where, when two date pickers are paired, the second date picker's starting date was using the first date picker's date as starting date *only* after a date was selected in the first date picker and not also when the first date picker already had a default date; thanks to **j-Walker**
- fixed an issue where the current system date was not highlighted if it was disabled; thanks to **Kevin Twitchell**
- the week number is now shown according to the [ISO 8601](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) standard; thanks to **David Moros** for the heads up;

## version 1.4 (July 08, 2012)

- fixed a bug where the date picker's icon was not centered vertically relative to the parent element;
- added the possibility to select only years and months or just years; this behavior will be automatically triggered when setting an appropriate format - something like "Y-m" will allow users to select only years/months, while something like "Y" will allow users to only select years;
- if the element the plugin is attached to is disabled, the icon for opening the date picker will be greyed out and the user will not be able to open the date picker; thanks **Todd**
- all sorts of imaginable combinations regarding starting and ending dates can now be set - look for the "direction" property in the configuration options for more information;
- two date picker's can now be "paired" so that one date picker's will use the value in the other as starting date; see the "pair" attribute;
- a callback function can now be set to be executed when the user selects a date; look for the "onSelect" property in the configuration options for more information;

## version 1.3.2 (April 20, 2012)

- included a second stylesheet for users who don't like the looks of the default one; thanks to **daniel** for reminding me about it;
- fixed icon position when inside the element on Opera; thanks **Daniel**;
- fixed a bug introduced in the last version that made disabling dates using , (commas) and - (dashes) impossible; thanks **Denis**;

## version 1.3.1 (April 07, 2012)

- fixed a bug where, starting with jQuery 1.7, the plugin was not working properly in IE6 & IE7; thanks to **Warren Taylor**;
- fixed a bug where the "Clear" button broke the date picker's layout in IE6 & IE7; thanks to **Warren Taylor**;

## version 1.3 (April 02, 2012)

- added a new property called "start_date" that can be used to specify a default starting date for the date picker, without having to set this value as the default value in the field the date picker is attached to; thanks to **Phill**;
- the date picker will now feature a button for clearing a previously selected date; this means that if the input the date picker is attached to is empty, and the user selects a date for the first time, this button will not be visible; once the user picked a date and opens the date picker again, this time the button will be visible; this button can be made permanently visible by setting the newly added "always_show_clear" property to TRUE; the caption of the button can be set through the newly added "lang_clear_date" property; thanks to **Marc**;
- the date picker can now be kept visible all the time by setting the newly added "always_visible" property to a jQuery element that will act as the date picker's container; thanks to **red** for suggesting this, and to everybody else for insisting :)
- fixed a bug where if the calendar icon didn't have any parents with "position: relative", it would appear at the very top of the page; thanks to **Primoz** and **nzn**;
- fixed a bug where pre-selected years and months were not highlighted if the date format didn't have days, months and years, but was something particular like "Y-m" or just "Y";
- fixed a bug where January was never highlighted in the month picker;

## version 1.2 (February 05, 2012)

- the icon for opening the datepicker is now, by default, *inside* the parent element rather than to its right; the old behaviour can still be achieved by setting the newly added "inside" property to FALSE;
- fixed a bug where the default view, as defined in the settings, was correctly used only the first time; subsequent clicks would open the datepicker in the "day picker" view, regardless of how it was set;
- fixed a bug where the currently selected years and months were not highlighted in the datepicker; only the current system year and month were highlighted previously;
- fixed a bug where, if a range of selectable dates was given, users could still navigate to years/months outside the given range (although no dates could be selected from these years/months as they were disabled);

## version 1.1.2 (September 11, 2011)

- fixed a bug where unavailable months and years could also be clicked and thus sending the user to a month with no selectable dates;

## version 1.1.1 (August 29, 2011)

- fixed a bug regarding event delegation that would crash the script in certain scenarios; thanks to **Sebi Popa** for spotting it!

## version 1.1 (August 24, 2011)

- fixed a bug where trying to re-initialize the date picker would attach an extra calendar icon and an extra date picker to the element; thanks to **Murat** for reporting;
- the "direction" property was enhanced and now can also be an array where the first value indicates the starting date and the direction of calendar, and the second value is the number of selectable days; thanks to **FranckM** for suggesting;
- week numbers can now also be shown using the *show_week_number* property (thanks to **Jorgen** for suggesting);
- if the *readonly_element* property is set to true (default), the date picker is also shown when the user clicks the input field; thanks to **Tomek** for suggesting;
- pressing the ESC key will now close the date picker;
- examples are now also available in the downloadable package;

## version 1.0, bugfix (May 27, 2011)

- a bug was fixed that prevented the script from using the date in the text box as default date

## version 1.0 (May 26, 2011)
